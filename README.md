# Excel-Project-
An interactive excel dashboard created.
I have created an excel dashboard using data about social media's influence on shopping. Got the data from data.world. I got a clean dataset and not much of cleaning was needed. Only quantitative data(no of voters) was available.
Link here - https://data.world/ahalps/social-influence-on-shopping.
I have used few formulas like Averageif, nestedif, sumif and xlookup for analysis purpose. 
Insights inferred:1. Most of the voters shopping habits were not influenced by social media, 2. Of those who have been influenced Instagram has got the highest votes, followed by Facebook. 3. Female genders shopping habits were influenced more compared to the male gender.
